# Documentation — Banker's Algorithm C++ Program

## 1. Overview

The Banker’s Algorithm is a resource-allocation and deadlock-avoidance algorithm.  
It checks whether granting resources to processes can still leave the system in a **safe state**, meaning all processes can complete.

This program:
- Reads Allocation, Max, and Available information from a text file.
- Computes Need = Max − Allocation.
- Simulates process execution to find a safe ordering.

## 2. Input File Format

The input file must contain:

1. `n m`  
   - n = number of processes  
   - m = number of resource types  

2. Next `n` lines: Allocation matrix  
3. Next `n` lines: Max matrix  
4. Final line: Available vector
